     <h2> Oil Changes: General Information</h2>
     <p>Timely oil changes are a vital part of auto maintenance, and arguably the biggest factor in increasing your vehicle’s longevity. Why is that you ask? Simply put, without oil, your engine can’t run properly. Oil lubricates engine parts so as to reduce wear and tear and prevent overheating. Routinely changing your oil is the best way to ensure optimal performance. Waiting too long between oil changes can result in:</p>
       <ul>
         <li>Decreased Engine Life/Efficiency</li>
         <li>Total Engine Failure</li>
           </ul>
           <p> Aside from their most obvious benefits, regular oil changes can do much more than just keep you on the road, they can:
             <ul>
               <li>Help You Keep Your Warranty</li>
               <li>Increase Your Vehicle's Resale Value</li>
               <li>Reduce Air Polution</li>
               </ul>
           
           <p> Every 3,000-5,000 miles was long thought to be the standard for oil change frequency. However, due to the variety of vehicles on the road today, experts  recommend consulting your owner's manual </p>
